# Static Assets Required

## Overview

Per Constitution Principle V (Static Asset Management), all UI icons must be manually downloaded and placed in the project.

## Required Images

| Icon | Type | Directory | File Name | Status |
|------|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| App Logo | PNG | `miniprogram/images/` | `logo.png` | ⚠️ NEEDED |
| Boxer Avatar Placeholder | PNG | `miniprogram/images/` | `boxer-placeholder.png` | ⚠️ NEEDED |
| Gym Icon Placeholder | PNG | `miniprogram/images/` | `gym-placeholder.png` | ⚠️ NEEDED |

## Action Required

Please download or create the above images and place them in `miniprogram/images/` directory.

## Temporary Placeholders

For now, the app references these images but they will show broken until added:
- `/images/logo.png` - Used in login page
- `/images/boxer-placeholder.png` - Used for boxer profiles
- `/images/gym-placeholder.png` - Used for gym profiles

## Notes

- Logo should be 200x200px
- Avatar placeholders should be 96x96px
- Use transparent backgrounds where appropriate
